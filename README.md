The necessities of the time have accorded to the petty interests of everyday life such overwhelming attention: the deep interests of actuality and the strife respecting these have engrossed all the powers and the forces of the mind — as also the necessary means — to so great an extent, that no place has been left to the higher inward life, the intellectual operations of a purer sort; and the better natures have thus been stunted in their growth, and in great measure sacrificed. Because the spirit of the world was thus occupied, it could not look within and withdraw into itself. - Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's speech at Heidelberg, on the 28th October, 1816

时代的艰苦使人对日常生活中平凡的琐屑的兴趣予以太大的重视，现实上很高的利益和为了这些利益而作的斗争，曾经大大地占据了精神上一切的能力和力量以及外在手段，因而使得人们没有自由的心情去理会那较高的内心活动和较纯洁的精神活动。以致许多较优秀的人才都为这种艰苦环境所束缚，并且部分地被牺牲在里面。因为世界精神太忙碌于现实，所以它不能转向内心，回复到自身。 ——黑格尔于 1816 年 10 月 28 日在海德堡大学的演讲
